        <p class="info magictime vanishIn blackbackground">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nice to meet you! <br> I currently am eighteen years old and study Computer Science Engineering student at the University of Florida.
        <br>Although I was born in the United States, in Brazil is where I was raised in lived most of my life. It was only in 2012 that I conviced my family to allow
        me to come back to the US, by myself, for high school. When I arrived I did not speak English and had no idea how the American educational system worked.
        In my freshman year, most of my classes were under the ESOL program (English for Speakers of Other Languages); it took me a lot of hard work, but by senior year three out of my six classes were AP (Advance Placement), and I was accepted into the best university in Florida.
